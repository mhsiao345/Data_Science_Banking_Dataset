Through the implementation of machine learning algorithms, an optimal solution was derived to answer the classification goal of where a client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y).

Detailed column descrptions and additional specifics on the context and content of this dataset is available on the provided kaggle link above.
    
### This machine learning data science project analysis concludes that the defined Decision Tree and Random Forest models yield a 98% predictive accuracy in answering the classification goal whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y).

### The results of this study is based off the supplied train and test datasets. Your results may vary with data that is atypical in comparison.
